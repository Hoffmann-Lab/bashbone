parset only works if it is a function. The function is defined as part
of env_parallel.

Do the below and restart your shell.

bash:  Put this in $HOME/.bashrc:  . `which env_parallel.bash`
       E.g. by doing:  echo '. `which env_parallel.bash`' >> $HOME/.bashrc
       Supports: variables, aliases, functions, arrays

ksh:   Put this in $HOME/.kshrc:  source `which env_parallel.ksh`
       E.g. by doing:  echo 'source `which env_parallel.ksh`' >> $HOME/.kshrc
       Supports: variables, aliases, functions, arrays

mksh:  Put this in $HOME/.mkshrc:  source `which env_parallel.mksh`
       E.g. by doing:  echo 'source `which env_parallel.mksh`' >> $HOME/.mkshrc
       Supports: variables, aliases, functions, arrays

pdksh: Put this in $HOME/.profile:  source `which env_parallel.pdksh`
       E.g. by doing:  echo '. `which env_parallel.pdksh`' >> $HOME/.profile
       Supports: variables, aliases, functions, arrays

zsh:   Put this in $HOME/.zshrc:  . `which env_parallel.zsh`
       E.g. by doing:  echo '. `which env_parallel.zsh`' >> $HOME/.zshenv
       Supports: variables, functions, arrays

ash:   Put this in $HOME/.profile:  . `which env_parallel.ash`
       E.g. by doing:  echo '. `which env_parallel.ash`' >> $HOME/.profile
       Supports: variables, aliases

dash:  Put this in $HOME/.profile:  . `which env_parallel.dash`
       E.g. by doing:  echo '. `which env_parallel.dash`' >> $HOME/.profile
       Supports: variables, aliases

fish:  Unsupported

csh:   Unsupported

tcsh:  Unsupported

To install in all shells run:

  parset --install

In a script you need to run this before using parset:

bash:  . `which env_parallel.bash`
ksh:   source `which env_parallel.ksh`
mksh:  source `which env_parallel.mksh`
pdksh: source `which env_parallel.pdksh`
zsh:   . `which env_parallel.zsh`
ash:   . `which env_parallel.ash`
dash:  . `which env_parallel.dash`

For details: see  man parset
